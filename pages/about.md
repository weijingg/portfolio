# Wei Jing Ang

I love maps and collecting rocks. As a fresh graduate with a major in Earth Science and specialisation in Geoscience, I have three journal publications and three years of research experience in GIS, remote sensing, hydrology, and geomorphology. I enjoy constantly learning new things, and I’m looking to broaden my experience in GIS and data visualisation, especially in cartographic design and urban analytics. With an interest in foreign cultures and minor in Modern Languages, I’m fluent in English, Chinese, and Japanese.
